- Always use Context7 for library documentation:
  - Before suggesting code for any external library, use resolve-library-id and get-library-docs
  - Never rely on training data for framework APIs (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.)
  - Pull docs first, then code
  - Use version-specific documentation when available
